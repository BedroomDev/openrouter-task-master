# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement task addition functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create functionality that allows users to add new tasks to the system
# Details:
Implement a function that accepts task details as input and adds it to the task collection. The task-addition functionality should include a CLI-Schnittstelle with interactive prompts using the inquirer library for enhanced user interaction. The function should collect these task attributes: title (required), description (optional), priority (high/medium/low), and dependencies (IDs of other tasks). Input validation should ensure that the title is not empty and that specified dependencies exist. The function should validate input and assign a unique identifier to each task.

# Test Strategy:
Test with valid and invalid inputs. Verify tasks are properly stored with correct attributes.
