# Task ID: 61
# Title: Implement Input Validation Framework for User Entries
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive validation framework that checks and validates user inputs across the application to prevent invalid data and improve user experience.
# Details:
Develop a flexible input validation system that can be applied to various types of user inputs throughout the application. The implementation should:

1. Create a core validation module with common validation functions for:
   - String inputs (length, format, special characters)
   - Numeric inputs (range, decimal precision, integer validation)
   - Date/time inputs (format validation, range checking)
   - Email and URL validation
   - Required field validation

2. Implement a validator factory that can create appropriate validators based on input type

3. Add support for custom validation rules and error messages that can be configured per field

4. Ensure validation happens in real-time where appropriate (client-side) and always on submission (server-side)

5. Design clear error reporting that provides users with actionable feedback on how to correct invalid inputs

6. Create a mechanism to highlight invalid fields visually

7. Ensure the validation framework is accessible and works with screen readers

8. Add sanitization features to prevent XSS and injection attacks

The validation system should be modular enough to be easily extended with new validation types in the future.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the validation framework works correctly across multiple scenarios:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test each validation function with valid and invalid inputs
   - Verify correct error messages are generated for each validation type
   - Test the validator factory creates appropriate validators
   - Test custom validation rules function correctly

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify validation works when integrated with form components
   - Test that client-side and server-side validation are consistent
   - Ensure error messages appear correctly in the UI

3. Edge case testing:
   - Test with boundary values (e.g., minimum/maximum lengths, ranges)
   - Test with special characters and potential injection attacks
   - Test with international characters and different locales

4. Accessibility testing:
   - Verify screen readers can properly announce validation errors
   - Test keyboard navigation for error correction

5. Performance testing:
   - Ensure validation doesn't significantly impact application performance
   - Test with large forms containing many validation rules

Create a validation test suite that can be run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
