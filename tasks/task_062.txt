# Task ID: 62
# Title: Implement User Input Validation Function
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a reusable validation function that checks user inputs against defined rules and provides meaningful error messages.
# Details:
Develop a modular validation function that can be used across the application to validate various types of user inputs. The function should:

1. Accept different validation rules (e.g., required fields, email format, password strength, numeric values, string length)
2. Support both synchronous and asynchronous validation (for database checks)
3. Return standardized validation results including:
   - Boolean indicating validity
   - Array of error messages if invalid
   - The field or input being validated
4. Allow for custom validation rules to be defined and registered
5. Support localized error messages
6. Include sanitization capabilities to prevent XSS and injection attacks
7. Provide a simple API for developers to implement validation with minimal code
8. Integrate with the existing Input Validation Framework from Task #61

The implementation should be optimized for performance and follow the DRY principle by centralizing validation logic.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests:
   - Test each validation rule separately with valid and invalid inputs
   - Test combinations of validation rules
   - Test asynchronous validation scenarios
   - Test custom validation rule registration
   - Test error message generation and localization
   - Test sanitization effectiveness against common XSS patterns

2. Integration tests:
   - Test the validation function in actual form submissions
   - Verify it correctly integrates with the existing validation framework
   - Test performance with large forms and complex validation rules

3. Edge cases to test:
   - Empty inputs
   - Extremely long inputs
   - Special characters and Unicode inputs
   - Inputs in different languages
   - Malicious input patterns

4. Manual testing:
   - Verify error messages are clear and helpful
   - Check that validation occurs at appropriate times (e.g., on blur, on submit)
   - Test accessibility of validation error presentation
